"""
DEPRECATED: This AWS Lambda function was used in the old notification processing architecture.

This Lambda-based implementation has been replaced by a standalone Notification Consumer Service
that follows a microservice-based architecture. The new implementation offers improved:

- Scalability: Decoupled components that can scale independently
- Reliability: Comprehensive retry strategy with exponential backoff
- Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns with standardized event format
- Observability: Detailed delivery status tracking
- Security: Improved token validation and rotation

See the notification system redesign document for details:
chat_management/docs/notification_system/notification_system_redesign.md

The new implementation is located in the notification_consumer directory.
